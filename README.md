Data Scientists love Jupyter (and other) notebooks since the notebooks are phenomenal when it comes to building and testing a machine learning model. A quick and easy way without any hassle, and it lets anyone start in data science without much hindrance. Notebooks are easy to use, easy to understand, and are widely used in the data science community for building and sharing models.
However, when it comes to deploying your model in a production system or building a microservices architecture, a Jupyter or any other notebook doesn’t serve any purpose. Lots of people have written why you shouldn’t keep working only in Jupyter notebooks (search on google), but this presentation stands out. I strongly recommend you to view this awesome work no matter wherever you are doing, totally worth your time
